# Information problem you're trying to solve
The Prince George's County community is faced with the daily risk of foodborne illness due to being unaware of the conditions of facilities where their food is outsourced.

# Identified stakeholders/target browsers
Prince George’s County residents, producers and consumers of food related organizations in Prince George’s County

# Data you chose to work with
The data we chose to utilize for this application is the food inspection database from the open portal data for Prince George’s County. We will use the Dataset API called Soda which is available on its website.

# Chosen strategies and solutions for the problem
As a solution to our information problem, we decided to create an application that will be available to the general public, which will yield the ability to search through various outlets including official/government inspections of source facilities to ensure that the Prince George’s County community food consumption sources are clean and up to date with all local, state, and federal health regulations. This application will raise the standard for food safety within this community and give the public a piece of mind about where their food sourced from.  

# How/if your final system helps to address the problem
Our final system will act as a solution to our information problem by making essential information accessible. The general public will be able to use our application and access important information pertaining to food source conditions that is required during the decision-making process by the public to deem if food is safe to consume based on local, state, and federal regulations. Our application provides all required information needed to make these decisions which will benefit the community and expunge the information gap pertaining to this specific issue.  

# Challenges faced and impact on final design
We had initially planned to include a map using the Leaflet.js library in our presentation that would be populated with the locations from the data points. This ended up being too daunting of a task to complete within the timeframe. 
Technical delays due to issues within Github and Netlify.
We struggled with executing the layout to make it consistent to view, both on the web and on the mobile app.

# Possible future work directions with this problem
Eventually this application could be expanded to service more states ultimately providing service to the entire United States. Also, another direction we would take is to potentially clean up the application for a more professional look, including pictures of facilities that are searched and consumer review options. Our long-term goal is to raise the standard in food safety while creating a collaborative community with the same goal of achieving complete consumption/food safety.
