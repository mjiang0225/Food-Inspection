# Food-Inspection
Prince George’s County Food Safety

# Project Description
We have realized that the community in Prince George's County is faced with daily risks of food borne illness all due to the fact of the unknown conditions where the community’s food supply is outsourced. To solve this problem, we have decided to create an application, accessible to the public, that allows individuals to search various outlets including official inspections of source facilities to ensure that what is being consumed by the community is outsourced from a clean and safe place. Users will have access to essential information including, type of food service, health inspection date, health inspection results, city, zip code, address, and inspection type. With this information being made available to the Prince George's County community through our application, we believe that a new standard of food safety will be set and the community can finally enjoy a piece of mind when consuming food from local outlets due to the significant reduction of the risk factor of consuming food from unknown sources.
